Political Disclaimer: I believe that actions such as prolonged occupation and genocide threaten to invalidate national sovereignty, and so to render the supposed need for national self-defense meaningless. For my part, I ask not to be considered responsible for the actions of any government that does not fully embrace the principles of democracy, including especially the principle of inalienable human rights.
